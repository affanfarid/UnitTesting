Have a seperate file for testing

always start the file with with "test_xxx.py"

import unittest module

create a class, inherit from unittest.TestCase

have a method in the class starting with "test_xxxx"

use this link for all the TestCase assert methods: 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.debug

run the actual test by this command line function:

python -m unittest test_calc.py

you can also add a block of code to the end of your test module to make it run directly when you run the module file

dont write as many as possible, just write GOOD tests. Quality > Quantity

TESTS DO NOT RUN IN ORDER

Setup and teardown run before/after every single test
setupClass and tearDownClass run once before/after all tests


Mocking, if you are testing a response, and you dont want to rely on actually getting a response
from an actual API, you can "mock" a response with the input

Tests shouldnt rely on other tests
